## Logs

### Saturn Logs

Saturn logs are used to identify errors with swapper and errors with Swapping, most errors happen at the end of the log or in the timestamp of when the error occured.

##### Your Saturn log is located at %localappdata%/Saturn/Logs/Saturn.log
##### [How to send a log](https://solar-stern-galaxy.is-a-skid.me/LZQ58t0g "How to send a log")
