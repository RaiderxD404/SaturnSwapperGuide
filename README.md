## Logs

### Saturn Logs

Saturn logs are used to identify errors with swapper and errors with Swapping, there is a lot of information in Saturn logs that you really do not need to know, but, most errors happen at the end of the log or in the minute when the error happened.

##### Your Saturn log is located at %localappdata%/Saturn/Logs/Saturn.log
##### [How to send a log](https://solar-stern-galaxy.is-a-skid.me/LZQ58t0g "How to send a log")
##### An example of a log:

```

##### S: You don't have enough space in your disk, you need around 20gbs to swap.


### Fortnite Logs

The Fortnite Logs are much more complicated than the Saturn Logs, the errors should be in the last 60 lines of the log.
##### Your Fortnite log is located at %localappdata%/FortniteGame/Saved/Logs/FortniteGame.log
